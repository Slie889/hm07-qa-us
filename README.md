SET UP
Connecting with Git and GitHub on this project. There are 2 steps below to set up the project,

Step 1: Connect with GitHub
The first step is to link GitHub account to the TripleTen. To do so, click the "Link GitHub account" button in the widget at the top of this page. This will take you to a new browser tab where you will be asked to confirm that you want to link your GitHub account. If you're not signed in to the GitHub already, you'll be asked to enter username and password. Upon confirming your TripleTen profile will be connected to your GitHub profile via GitHub's secure API. 

Step 2: Clone the repo to your computer
Once you have linked your TripleTen account with the GitHub, a repository will be created automatically. The repository name will be hm07-qa-us. Go to GitHub and clone the new repo to your local computer, using the following steps:
1. Open your preferred terminal emulator. If you're on Windows, use Git Bash.
2. Create a directory to store all of your projects.
    Example: cd ~ (make sure you're in your home directory)
             mkdir projects (create a folder called projects)
             cd projects (change directory into the new projects folder)   
3. Clone the repo. The command you use will depend on the authentication strategy that you're using.
    Example: - If you are using HTTPS
                git clone https://github.com/username/hm07-qa-us.git
             - If you are using SSH
                git clone git@github.com:username/hm07-qa-us.git
